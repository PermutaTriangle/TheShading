The Shading Algorithm
=====================
The Shading Algorithm is an algorithm that decides coincidence of mesh
patterns. This repository contains an implementation of The Shading Algorithm
and other methods for coincidence classification.

The algorithm can be used by running `classify.py` script. The script has
options using The Shading Lemma and the Simultaneous Shading Lemma. For The
Shading Algorithm, the flag takes as parameter the maximum recursion depth to
run the algorithm to and has options for maximum length of force.

Coincidence classification
--------------------------
The coincidence classification of mesh patterns with underlying patterns *12*,
*123* and *132* are given in `results/final_results`.
